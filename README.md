# Crime Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict crime types and recommend appropriate police deployment based on the given time, location, and other contextual data.

---

## Features

- Predicts the **type of crime** based on date, time, and location inputs.
- Recommends the **most suitable police deployment** for the predicted crime.
- Uses **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, and other ML models.
- Simple interface using **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation and testing.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run this project locally:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishant1194/crime_Prediction.git
cd crime_Prediction
```

### Step 2: Step 2: Install Python
Check if Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

### Step 3: Install pip (Python Package Installer)
If pip is not installed, run:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

```

Check pip version:

```bash
pip --version
```

### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the Environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On Mac:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies
Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

###Step 6: Install Jupyter Notebook

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Step 7: Launch Jupyter Notebook


```bash
jupyter notebook
```


### Step 8: Run the Project

- Jupyter will open in your browser.
- Navigate to the crime_Prediction folder.
- There will be a dataset1.csv which we use in this ml project.
- Open the notebook ( .ipynb).
